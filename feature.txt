The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
A stitch in time saves nine.
All that glitters is not gold.
Time and tide wait for none.
The early bird catches the worm.
Jack of all trades, master of none.
Barking up the wrong tree.
A penny saved is a penny earned.
Actions speak louder than words.
